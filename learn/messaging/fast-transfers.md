# Composable Intents

## Overview

Composable Intents is a cross-chain transfer protocol designed to enable faster-than-finality transfers across the Wormhole ecosystem through a novel hub-and-spoke architecture centered on Solana. This architecture allows solvers to facilitate cross-chain transfers by fronting assets on the destination chain and assuming the finality risk of the originating source chain transaction. Solvers, however, concentrate their entire liquidity on Solana, where they participate in permissionless on-chain Dutch auctions to fulfill each cross-chain transfer. Upon the conclusion of each auction, the winning solver initiates a transfer from Solana to the specified destination chain. The solver rebalances inventory once the originating source chain transaction reaches finality and arrives to Solana.

Composable Intents is meant to serve as the underlying chain abstraction infrastructure layer for protocols across Wormhole connected ecosystems by enabling protocols to bundle payloads containing arbitrary protocol actions, which can be executed atomically alongside each transfer. This feature allows developers to create fully chain-abstracted user experiences, including the construction of natively cross-chain decentralized exchanges, borrow-lend protocols, and other applications atop of this layer.

## Architecture Motivation

### Solvers and Liquidity Fragmentation

Traditional intent-based protocols require solvers to distribute their capital across each supported chain in the network. This fragmentation of liquidity leads to capital inefficiency and necessitates complex rebalancing to manage asymmetric flows between chains, imposing significant operational overhead on solvers. As the number of chains increases, solvers face scalability challenges, which can result in market concentration, reducing competition and potentially harming user welfare.

Composable Intents addresses these challenges by consolidating solver liquidity on a single chain—Solana—using a hub-and-spoke model. This model eliminates the need for complex cross-chain rebalancing and simplifies infrastructure requirements for solvers. Solvers only need to consider the finality risk of the originating source chain transaction and the payload when bidding on transfers. By concentrating liquidity on Solana, the protocol can handle large transfer volumes with a smaller capital base, enhancing capital efficiency and lowering barriers to entry for solvers. This approach promotes competition, improves overall market efficiency, and ultimately benefits users with better prices while still preserving the speed of transactions.

### Transfer Rails: Enabling Unified Liquidity through Cross-Chain Fungibility

The novel hub-and-spoke liquidity architecture relies on interoperable token standards that enable cross-chain fungibility, such as Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) and Wormhole's Native Token Transfers (NTT). These protocols allow assets to move seamlessly between chains, making unified liquidity possible.

!!! note
    Circle’s CCTP protocol allows USDC to be transferred across chains through native burn-and-mint model. Wormhole’s NTT is an open-source, flexible framework for transferring tokens across blockchains. It gives integrators full control over token behavior on each chain, including token standards, metadata, ownership, upgradeability, and custom features. Tokens can be configured for either burn/lock-and-mint, depending on integrator preferences.


On the liquidity hub (Solana), solvers concentrate their liquidity in NTT or CCTP assets, such as USDC. These assets act as the medium of value transfer between chains but may not necessarily be the user's original or final asset.

After the Solana auction concludes, the appropriate instructions are called on the CCTP or NTT contract initiating the transfer from Solana to the destination chain by burning/locking the asset on Solana and sequentially minting on the destination chain. Solvers rebalance their inventory on Solana using these interoperable token standards as well. Once the originating source chain transaction reaches finality and arrives at Solana, the solver can redeem the NTT or CCTP message, minting the inventory for use once again.

By leveraging interoperable token standards like NTT, this model of liquidity facilitation for cross-chain intents can **arbitrarily scale** to any chain or ecosystem while preserving fully unified liquidity—eliminating the need for solver "buy-in" for new chain expansion. Additionally, this means new chains, even without proven traction, can access the same amount of liquidity for cross-chain intent fulfillment from day one of MainNet launch as they would if they were long-standing ecosystems with clear evidence of adoption — commonly overlooked by solvers who must aggressively prioritize high flow chains to due high opportunity costs.  This includes new ecosystems without Centralized Exchange (CEX) enabled withdrawals.

### Understanding the Hub: Solana Matching Engine

A central component of the protocol architecture is the permissionless Dutch auction conducted on Solana, specifically the Matching Engine contract, allowing any third-party solver to interact with the matching engine to place bids or improve existing ones. The Matching Engine Contract includes three key instructions:

- **`placeInitialBid`** - starts an auction for a fast transfer with an initial fee bid. The initial bidder will receive a fee for placing the initial bid. This function calls **`improveBid`** internally so that subsequent bidders will not waste gas when racing to start an auction
- **`improveBid`** - allows solvers to submit a lower fee bid on an existing auction. The fee bid must be less than the current bid. With each successful call of **`improveBid`**, the prior bid is atomically sent back to its solver, allowing that solver to repurpose those funds if it so chooses to improved the bid that undercut its initial bid
- **`executeFastOrder`** - following conclusion of the auction, this instruction completes the fast transfer by sending funds to the recipient on the target chain. This instruction may call the Circle CCTP contract (or soon the NTT contract), depending on the shuttle asset in question. Failure to execute this message within a predefined grace period may result in penalty for the winning bidder (more on this below)

When placing a bid—whether initial or improved—the solver must deposit the required funds _plus_ a **security deposit** into the matching engine contract. In this permissionless auction, the requirement of this principal amount plus the security deposit ensures a solver's credible commitment to fulfill the transfer. Malicious actors could place hollow bids without this safeguard, undermining the auction's credibility and hindering true price discovery.

Following the auction, the winning solver has a predetermined grace period to call the **`executeFastOrder`** instruction to initiate the transfer to the destination chain. If the winning solver fails to do so, other competing solvers may permissionlessly ‘slash’ the solver by executing the instruction their behalf, collecting a portion of the original security deposit as a reward while the remaining portion is routed to the user as compensation for the unanticipated delay. This mechanism is designed to properly incentivize timely execution through solver redundancy and competition.

## Summarizing the Protocol Flow: How It Works

- **Initiation** - users or protocols initiate a transfer via an interface or directly on-chain. They choose between a standard transfer (waiting for finality on the sending chain) or a fast transfer (triggering the auction process). For fast transfers, users or the protocol specify a maximum fee and an auction start deadline

    !!! note 
        If an auction doesn't start within the set deadline, a standard transfer will proceed directly from the source to the destination chain

- **Auction** — solvers monitor the Wormhole network for these fast transfer requests and initiate an auction on the Solana by offering to fulfill the transfer at or below the user's maximum fee. To start the auction, the solver must transfer the requested funds plus a _small security deposit_ to the Matching Engine contract
- **Competition** — once initiated, other solvers can participate by submitting lower bids in a simple Dutch auction, aiming to provide users with the best rate. If a new solver submits a better offer, the previous solver's funds and security deposit are returned, with the new offer taking precedence atomically. This competition ensures that users receive the best possible transfer rate
- **Fulfillment** — after the auction concludes, the winning solver must complete the transfer within a predefined grace period to earn their fee and reclaim their security deposit. Failure to do so may result in the security deposit being slashed, with the slashed amount compensating the user for delays. This mechanism incentivizes prompt execution. Upon successful completion, the Fast Transfer hub sends the USDC to the user's destination wallet, and the solver receives their security deposit and transfer fee
- **Settlement** — once the original source chain transaction reaches finality, the winning solver can use the finalized Wormhole message to settle the auction with the matching engine and rebalance. This allows the solver to retrieve the original transfer amount into their wallet
